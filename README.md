# SoccerVis
Collection of soccer analytics visualizations

This is a collection of various visualizations of data from Statsbomb's open source data collection, experimenting with various types of graphics and visualizations. Most code uses the mplsoccer python package to create soccer specific visuals, relying on mplsoccer's extremely helpful tutorials. Various data sources and code sources should be cited in individual files as well.

All "Map" files pertain to the 30DayMap Challenge, found here: https://30daymapchallenge.com/, which occured in November 2022.
To see tweets with the various graphics I've created, go to this twitter thread: https://twitter.com/Soccer_Soundoff/status/1587663156544999424?s=20&t=RK6CqL9X0-QRIJIHkxEUFw
